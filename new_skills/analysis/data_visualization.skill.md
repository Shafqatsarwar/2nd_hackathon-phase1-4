# Data Visualization Skill

## Purpose
Automatically creates insightful visualizations from datasets to help identify trends, patterns, and outliers.

## Functionality
- Analyzes data structure and suggests appropriate chart types
- Generates various visualization types (bar, line, scatter, pie, heatmap)
- Identifies correlations and patterns in the data
- Creates dashboard-like reports with multiple views
- Provides statistical insights alongside visualizations

## Input

- Specific metrics to highlight
- Target audience for the visualization

## Output
- Generated visualizations (charts, graphs, plots)
- Summary report with insights
- Interactive dashboard components
- Statistical analysis results
- Recommendations for further analysis

## LOC
Approximately 350-450 lines of code

## Measurement
- Time reduction: From 30-60 minutes manual chart creation to 5-10 minutes automated generation
- Consistency: Uniform styling and approach across all visualizations
- Insights: Automatic pattern detection vs. manual inspection
