## Feature: [Feature Name]  
### Phase I — In-Memory Python Console App

---

### 1. Context

This specification defines the work required to implement the **[Feature Name]** feature for **Phase I** of *The Evolution of Todo* project.

This feature is governed by:  
- `constitution.md` (Phase I)  
- Spec-Kit Plus rules  
- Claude Code execution model  

---

### 2. Objective

Define the specific goal of the feature in one or two sentences.  

---

### 3. Preconditions

- Application is running in a terminal  
- Relevant in-memory collections exist  
- User has selected the appropriate menu option  

---

### 4. Tasks Breakdown

#### Task 1: [Task Title]
**Description:** Briefly describe what this task does.  

**Rules:**  
- List all rules, validations, or constraints for this task  

**Output:** Describe what the task produces  

---

#### Task 2: [Task Title]
**Description:** ...  

**Rules:** ...  

**Output:** ...  

---

*(Add more tasks as needed)*

---

### 5. Postconditions

- List expected outcomes after feature execution  
- Data consistency and program state requirements  

---

### 6. Error Handling

- List possible errors and how they should be handled  
- Include user prompts, validation messages, and safe recovery  

---

### 7. Constraints

- In-memory storage only  
- Console input/output only  
- No persistence or external services  
- No advanced fields beyond Phase I scope  

---

### 8. Acceptance Criteria

Feature is complete when:  
- List measurable conditions for success  
- Ensure implementation is fully spec-driven  

---

### 9. Traceability

This specification traces to:  
- `constitution.md` (Phase I)  
- Spec-Kit Plus  
- Claude Code execution model
