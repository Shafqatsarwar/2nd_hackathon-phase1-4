## Feature: [Feature Name]  
### Phase I — In-Memory Python Console App

---

### 1. Context

This plan outlines the step-by-step approach to implement the **[Feature Name]** feature for **Phase I** of *The Evolution of Todo* project.

This plan is governed by:  
- `constitution.md` (Phase I)  
- Spec-Kit Plus rules  
- Claude Code execution model  

---

### 2. Objective

Describe the implementation goal for the feature clearly and concisely.

---

### 3. Preconditions

- Application running in terminal  
- Required in-memory data structures exist  
- User has selected the corresponding menu option  

---

### 4. Implementation Steps

#### Step 1: [Step Title]
**Description:** Briefly describe the step.  

**Inputs Required:** List any inputs needed from user or memory  

**Process:** Describe how the step will be executed  

**Outputs Produced:** Describe results of this step  

---

#### Step 2: [Step Title]
